- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Build aiogram-based Telegram bot for GetniusVPN with onboarding, device setup, tariffs, profile, FAQ, referral, and RU/EN language switch.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - No existing codebase in `C:\Users\alien\Desktop\VPN`.
  - Use copy adapted from user-provided notes and screenshots.
  - External integrations (payments, key issuance) are placeholders until provided.
- Key decisions:
  - Implement minimal aiogram v3 skeleton with inline/reply keyboards and in-memory language preference.
- State:
  - Done:
    - Added `AGENTS.md` with continuity instructions adapted for GetniusVPN.
    - Created aiogram bot skeleton with core flows and RU/EN copy.
  - Now:
    - Verify flows and collect missing business data (token, pricing, links).
  - Next:
    - Wire to real key issuance, payments, and analytics.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - Bot token, payment URLs, key issuance method, support contact, channel link.
  - Final pricing and trial duration.
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
  - `AGENTS.md`, `CONTINUITY.md`, `src/*`, `.env.example`, `requirements.txt`
