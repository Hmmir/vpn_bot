- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Deliver GetniusVPN Telegram bot with onboarding, device setup, tariffs, profile, FAQ, referral, RU/EN, media cards, and automated expiry reminders; add support bot + channel integration.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Keep secrets out of git; use `.env` on server.
  - Use user-provided screenshots/copy; match competitor flow (2-column buttons) but rephrase branding.
  - Payments/key issuance are placeholders until provided.
- Key decisions:
  - Aiogram v3 bot; SQLite storage at `data/bot.db`; hourly reminder loop.
  - Media assets in `assets/` and helper mapping in `src/media.py`.
- State:
  - Done:
    - Added media cards (welcome/pricing/pro/referral/steps) and updated bot flows to send images.
    - Added `python-dotenv`, `src/storage.py` for reminders, admin commands (`/set_expire`, `/set_plan`).
    - Updated texts/keyboards for RU/EN, 2-column device buttons, tariffs/pro/referral flows.
    - Added support/channel buttons + handlers, support bot (`src/support_bot.py`), and updated `.env.example` + `.gitignore` (add `data/`).
    - Added support/channel images into `assets/` (support.png, channel.png).
    - Removed privacy email line from profile/support copy.
    - Added 3x-ui API client scaffolding and admin issue command (`/issue`, `/xui_inbounds`).
  - Now:
    - Push changes to GitHub.
    - Configure XUI env vars and test `/issue`.
    - Redeploy to server and restart bot(s).
  - Next:
    - Wire payments + auto key issuance; add runbook/systemd and tests.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - Support bot token/username, support admin chat ID, channel link.
  - Final pricing, trial duration, renewal URL.
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
  - `src/main.py`, `src/texts.py`, `src/keyboards.py`, `src/media.py`, `src/storage.py`, `.env.example`, `assets/*`
